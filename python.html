	<h1> Unit 1 </h1>
	<h2> Moving Guy </h2>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h2> Description </h2>
	<p>We were tasked with making the guy move in this project using the WASD keys.  We had to make it so that when one of those keys were pressed, the guy would move in a certain direction.  This lab was challenging as I kept having errors because I was still learning how to make the class file interact with the runner.  Eventually though, I learned how to make it interact and how to make the guy move if a certain key was pressed.</p>
	<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>How to use if statements</li>
		<li>How to make a class and runner work together</li>
		<li>How to program keys to make an object move</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1> Unit 2 </h1>
	<h2> Line Runner </h2>
	<p>
		<img src="Images/unit2.png"/ width="600" height="400">
	</p>
	<h2> Description </h2>
	<p>We were tasked with completing a side crolling program where you had to jump over incoming objects.  After we got the program to work, we had to add our own objects into the game.  We had to add one that increased the score and one that decreased it.  I added in a bomb and a coin.  The coin is Obama's face because he is awesome.  To create the bomb and coin we had to create two new classes from scratch.  We also had to make the objects affect the score mechanism to either detract from it or increase it.</p>
	<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>How to use if statements</li>
		<li>How to create a class from scratch</li>
		<li>How to make objects detract or add from score</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1> Unit 3 </h1>
	<h2> Coin/Background Game </h2>
	<p>
		<img src="Images/unit3.png"/ width="600" height="400">
	</p>
	<h2> Description </h2>
	<p>At first, we were tasked with creating a background from only 2 images.  We had to make the images repeat until the whole background was covered by the images.  After that, we had to put our person in from unit 1 and make him work on the screen.  We also made boulders appear for aesthetic.  Then we had to program in a coin and a timer.  This made it so that you had to collect a certain amount of coins before the timer ran out.  The coin would appear in random places and the player would have to hurry to collect 10 coins in 10 seconds.</p>
	<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Random placement of objects</li>
		<li>While true loops</li>
		<li>Repeating bits of code</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1> Unit 4 </h1>
	<h2> Costume Guy </h2>
	<p>
		<img src="Images/unit4.png"/ width="600" height="400">
	</p>
	<h2> Description </h2>
	<p>We were tasked with finding a sprite sheet and then making that sprite sheet work so that the sprite looked animated.  We had to make a list of costumes and corilate the items in that list to appear when a certain key was pressed.  For example, if the left key was pressed, the costume that made the guy look like he was walking to the left would be called and would appear on the screen.  This lab was ery interesting to me and I would later go on to use the same code in my final project.</p>
	<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>How to write and use lists</li>
		<li>How to create and use a sprite sheet</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1> Final Project </h1>
	<h2> Procrastination </h2>
	<p>
		<img src="Images/final5.png"/ width="600" height="400">
	</p>
	<h2> Description </h2>
	<p>For our final project, we were allowed to make a game however we wanted to. The only peramiters where that it had to work, contain basic python code that we have learned up to this point, contain a list, and to get an A it had to conatin a title page and tutorial screen.  My project contained all of these.  I created a prject similair to the line runner project where objects came flying at you but I also added in another element where you had to reach an A at the end of the screen.  The A increased the players score by a lot more than jumping over the phones.  In order to beat the game, the player must avoid the phones while also trying to reach the A at the end of the screen.</p>
	<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>How to create and use a title screen</li>
		<li>How to add music into a game</li>
