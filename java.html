		<h1> Concepts Learned </h1>
		<p>In the beginning of our unit in Java, we learned the basic mechanics of the program and how to write basic code.  I was familiar with Java as I have taken a class on it before and since we had a unit with Jeroo which uses Java.  I learned how to use if statements in Java and how to attach strings of code so that they all work together.  I aso learned to make the code get user input from the player.</p>
		<h1> Final Project </h1>

		<h2> Description </h2>
		<p>In this project we were tasked with creating a text based adventure where the user was given different options and inputted any option they felt was best.  The options must lead to more options and eventually to an end to the story.  My project was about a bank robbery where you were trying to escape from the police.  Based on what the user inputted, you could make it out with all, some, or none of the money that you originally stole from the bank.</p>
		<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>

			<li>Coding User Input Into The Game</li>
			<li>Attaching If Statements To Each Other</li>
