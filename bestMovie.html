	<h2 style="color:tomato;"> Why I Like the Movie </h2>
	
	I like the movie because it shows the struggle between man and the harsh outdoors.  It shows what it takes to win the greates off road race in the world, the baja 1000.  The movie also gives you an incredible behind the scenes visual of everythinhg that goes on in the race.

	<h2 style="color:tomato;"> My Favorite Actor </h2>
	
	My favorite actor in the movie is not really an actor since the movie is a documentary.  He is a real person and his name is Pete Sohren.  He is not rich like the rest of the racers so he has to work countless hours on his truck to compete.
