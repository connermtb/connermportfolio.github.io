		<h1>Name Assignment</h1>

		</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> In this project, I used individual sprites to spell out my name and a sprite that represented something I liked.  I chose a taco because I like tacos.  When the flag was clicked, the sprites had to display 3 different behaviors.  For extra credit, I had to add some code that would make all of the letters reset to their original places.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Using event blocks like “when green flag is clicked”</li>
			<li>Using forever loops</li>
			<li>Using motion blocks so that the different sprites would move</li>
			<li>Using the looks block to have the letters change colors rapidly</li>
			<li>Sprites used to spell out my name and for the taco</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Computer Buying Project</h1>
		<p>
			<img src="Images/compbuyingprojectscreen.png"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> We were tasked with finding a computer for James’ brother.  He was going to be using the computer to animate and he had a budget $1600.  The computers that we chose for him were made by razer, dell, lenovo, and mac.  We ended up choosing the dell as it offered the best performance for the price.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Learned what all of the computer components did and how to compare them</li>
			<li>Learned how to use if statements</li>
			<li>Learned how to use speech bubble to make the sprite communicate</li>
			<li>Learned how to use the “when touching color” block</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Final Project</h1>
		<p>
			<img src="Images/GameProjectScreen.png"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> For the final project, we were tasked to either create a game or story in scratch.  I chose to create a game.  The game I created was a side scrolling motorcycle game.  You had to collect the green dots while avoiding the red dots on the screen.  It worked pretty well and kept score.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Learned how to import a background from the internet</li>
			<li>Learned how to create a scrolling background</li>
			<li>Learned how to use variables to keep score</li>
			<li>Learned how to make a sprite jump while not affecting the x-axis movement</li>
			<li>Learned how to import a sprite from a file into the program</li>
		</ul>
